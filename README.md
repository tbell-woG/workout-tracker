# Project Description
It is the beginning of 2021 and with each new year many people make New Years resolutions. Too often, people make resolutions to improve their health and well-being by exercising more or joining a gym. Well with that being said, the Workout Tracker Application, will make it easier for someone to track their daily workouts and accomplish their fitness goals. This application will allow users to create, view, and track their daily workouts. They can log  their exercises in by entering the exercise name, type, weight, sets, reps, duration, and distance traveled (if it is cardio) of the exercise. They can also view a summary of their workout progress over the previous 7 days on the Workout Dashboard page. This page will display the duration in minutes of their workout each day, the pounds they lifted each day, and what exercises they performed over the week.
